[2024-02-17 21:29:57.419883] DEBUG: runclient: Examine the following time series data. The data is in comma separated format (CSV) with two columns. A datetime value and a price data value. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values for all the data values and save the time of the maximum value. If the maximum value is greater than 40, then it is "GOLD". If the maximum value is greater than 30, then it is "SILVER". If the value is greater than 25, then it is "BRONZE". If the value is less than 20, then it is "NOGAME". Set the PeakLmp to the price. If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. The number of hours is 2. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". The LMP $4000. Set the startime to the datetime when the value was selected and set the duration to 120 mins.

[2024-02-17 21:30:29.002912] DEBUG: runclient: The analysis of the given time series data has been completed. Here are the results:

- Average Load: 25.66
- Maximum Load: 33.17 (SILVER status)
- Minimum Load: 19.77
- Time of Maximum Load: 2/17/2024 6:00:00 PM

Given the maximum load value is greater than 30 and labeled as "SILVER," a GridPeakDetected message has been sent to C2Agent, and notices have been dispatched to both the CommandCenter and the ControlPanel regarding the detected grid peak with SILVER status.
