[2024-02-19 16:03:47.416702] DEBUG: runclient: why is the sky blue?
[2024-02-19 16:04:04.935479] DEBUG: runclient: The sky appears blue to the human eye because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of light of various colorsâ€”each of which has a different wavelength. Oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the Earth's atmosphere scatter the sunlight in all directions. 

Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This scattering causes the sky to look blue in the daytime. At sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the light is passing through more of the Earth's atmosphere, causing the blue light to scatter out of the line of sight and allowing the longer wavelengths of red and orange to dominate.
[2024-02-19 16:05:24.161551] DEBUG: runclient: Examine the following time series data. The data is in comma separated format (CSV) with two columns. A datetime value and a load data value. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values for all the data values and save the time of the maximum value. If the maximum value is greater than 100000, then it is "GOLD". If the maximum value is greater than 98000, then it is "SILVER". If the value is greater than 94500, then it is "BRONZE". If the value is less than 94500, then it is "NOGAME". If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. The number of hours is 2. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". The LMP $4000. Set the startime to the datetime when the value was selected and set the duration to 120 mins.

[2024-02-19 16:07:16.838632] DEBUG: runclient: I have analyzed the time series data and calculated the average, maximum, and minimum values as follows:

- Average Load: 94,980.67
- Maximum Load: 101,541 (Occurred on 02/19/2024 07:00:00 PM)
- Minimum Load: 89,591

Based on the maximum load value, the classification is "GOLD".

I've sent a "GridPeakDetected" message indicating a GOLD event to the C2Agent, and also sent notice messages with the same information to both the CommandCenter and the ControlPanel.

[2024-02-19 19:29:21.564880] DEBUG: runclient: The sky appears blue to the human eye because of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere. The light from the Sun looks white, but it is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow. When sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the air.

Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This scattering causes the sky to look blue in most places during the day. At sunrise and sunset, the sky can become a beautiful orange or red because the light has to pass through more of the atmosphere, causing blue light to scatter out of the line of sight, and the longer wavelengths of light such as red and orange become more visible.
