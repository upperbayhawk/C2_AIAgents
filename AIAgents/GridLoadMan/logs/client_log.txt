Based on the previous analysis, the average load value was calculated as 25.48, the maximum load value was 33.17 (occurring at 02/17/2024 06:00:00 PM), and the minimum load value was 19.77. The maximum load value fell into the "SILVER" category.

Since the data and its analysis results have not changed, the actions taken previously, including sending a GridPeakDetected message to C2Agent and sending notices to both the CommandCenter and ControlPanel, still apply. The peak load was marked as "SILVER", indicating that the maximum value was greater than 30 but not exceeding 40, and appropriate messages were dispatched accordingly.
