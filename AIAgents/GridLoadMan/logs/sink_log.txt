The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values for all the data values and save the time of the maximum value. If the maximum value is greater than 100000, then it is "GOLD". If the maximum value is greater than 98000, then it is "SILVER". If the value is greater than 94500, then it is "BRONZE". If the value is less than 94500, then it is "NOGAME". If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. The number of hours is 2. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". The LMP $4000. Set the startime to the datetime when the value was selected and set the duration to 120 mins.
