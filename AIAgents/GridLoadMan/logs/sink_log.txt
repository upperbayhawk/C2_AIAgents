[2024-02-17 22:14:17.218937] DEBUG: runsink: Examine the following time series data. The data is in comma separated format (CSV) with two columns. A datetime value and a price data value. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values for all the data values and save the time of the maximum value. If the maximum value is greater than 40, then it is "GOLD". If the maximum value is greater than 30, then it is "SILVER". If the value is greater than 25, then it is "BRONZE". If the value is less than 20, then it is "NOGAME". Set the PeakLmp to the price. If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. The number of hours is 2. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". The LMP $4000. Set the startime to the datetime when the value was selected and set the duration to 120 mins.

Since the maximum load value categorizes as "SILVER," I've sent a GridPeakDetected message to C2Agent and also forwarded the message as a notice to both the CommandCenter and ControlPanel.

[2024-02-17 22:19:23.607349] DEBUG: runsink: The provided data is identical to the previously examined dataset. Based on the previous analysis, the average load value was calculated as 25.48, the maximum load value was 33.17 (occurring at 02/17/2024 06:00:00 PM), and the minimum load value was 19.77. The maximum load value fell into the "SILVER" category.

Since the data and its analysis results have not changed, the actions taken previously, including sending a GridPeakDetected message to C2Agent and sending notices to both the CommandCenter and ControlPanel, still apply. The peak load was marked as "SILVER", indicating that the maximum value was greater than 30 but not exceeding 40, and appropriate messages were dispatched accordingly.
