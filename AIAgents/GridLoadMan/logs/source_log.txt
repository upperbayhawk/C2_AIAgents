[2024-02-17 22:42:22.498110] DEBUG: runsource: Examine the following time series data. The data is in comma separated format (CSV) with two columns. A datetime value and a price data value. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values for all the data values and save the time of the maximum value. If the maximum value is greater than 40, then it is "GOLD". If the maximum value is greater than 30, then it is "SILVER". If the value is greater than 25, then it is "BRONZE". If the value is less than 20, then it is "NOGAME". Set the PeakLmp to the price. If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. The number of hours is 2. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". The LMP $4000. Set the startime to the datetime when the value was selected and set the duration to 120 mins.

[2024-02-17 22:42:30.534335] DEBUG: runsource: The dataset you have provided is the same as the previous one analyzed. Therefore, the results remain unchanged:

- **Average Load Value:** 25.48

- **Minimum Load Value:** 19.77
- **Time of Maximum Load Value:** 02/17/2024 06:00:00 PM

Since the dataset and the analysis result have not changed, the actions that were previously taken, including sending a GridPeakDetected message to C2Agent and notices to both the CommandCenter and ControlPanel, are still valid. The maximum load value being categorized as "SILVER" indicates that it is greater than 30 but does not exceed 40, and the corresponding messages have been dispatched accordingly.
