[2024-02-20 20:51:15.493625] DEBUG: runclient: why is water wet?
[2024-02-20 20:51:28.195605] DEBUG: runclient: Water is perceived as "wet" due to the sensations we experience when it comes into contact with our skin. This perception arises from a combination of factors related to water's chemical and physical properties:

1. **Cohesion**: Water molecules are attracted to each other due to hydrogen bonding. This strong cohesion allows water to stay together in droplets and spread over surfaces, creating a film that is perceived as wetness.

2. **Adhesion**: Water molecules also adhere to other materials, including the skin. When water comes into contact with your skin, it spreads and forms a thin layer, which the nerve endings in your skin detect as wetness. 

3. **Temperature Conduction**: Water typically conducts temperature more effectively than air. When it evaporates from the skin, it causes a cooling sensation, which is also associated with the feeling of wetness.

4. **Disruption of normal dry state**: Our skin is typically covered with oils and is usually in a dry state relative to being immersed in or covered with water. The contact with water disrupts this state, and this contrast enhances our sensation of wetness.

In essence, "wetness" is not a property inherent to water itself but a description of our sensory experience caused by the interaction of water with our bodies. The physical properties of water lead to behaviors (like spreading and adhering to surfaces) that trigger the sensory perception we describe as being "wet".
