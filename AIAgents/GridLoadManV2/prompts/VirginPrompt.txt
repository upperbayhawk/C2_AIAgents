The file LMP_LOAD.csv is a file with comma separated values and contains Datetime, Price and Load data. Each value is an hourly value. There are multiple hourly values each day. Remove all duplicate hourly load values within each day. Calculate the maximum daily load values for each day from the remaining unique hourly values for that day along with the timestamps when those daily maximum values occurred. Display and remember the results.  Calculate the minimum, maximum and standard deviation of those daily maximum values and remember the results. Display and remember the daily maximum load values and the number of days with maximum loads above 3, 2 and 1 standard deviations above the average load. Select and remember the number of values above 1 standard deviation above the average. Display and remember the load value of this 1 standard deviation above average. Save this value by calling the putSensorValueByName function using the name PeakThresholdLoad.
