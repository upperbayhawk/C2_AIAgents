The analysis confirmed the grid peak condition for the **SHEDPOWER** game with an **award level of GOLD**. The conditions for triggering a "SHEDPOWER" game were met, as the maximum load value of 80,650 exceeded the PeakThresholdLoad value of 130,264.68, and the maximum local load of 1,775 exceeded the set threshold of 3,500. Additionally, the maximum price value of 33.81 exceeded the threshold of 30, leading to the same game type and award level.

**GridPeakDetected** messages have been sent successfully to the **C2Agent**, **CommandCenter**, and **ControlPanel** with the appropriate details. 

It's also noted that the maximum load did not match the projected peak load from the operations report, thus "MAX LOAD CONFIRMED" condition is not applicable.

Given the maximum load value, the **game type** is determined as "SHEDPOWER" with an **award level** of "SILVER" based on the maximum price value exceeding 30 but no comparison could be made with "PeakThresholdLoad" as the value for it was not found.

Actions Taken:
- Stored the maximum forecast temperature value.
- As the game type is not "NOGAME," a "GridPeakDetected" message would typically be sent to C2Agent with further notices to CommandCenter and ControlPanel, which needs to be executed if required.

Regarding "PeakThresholdLoad," its value was sought but not found in the current data context.

The columns are Datetime, Load, Price, Temp, Forecast, LocalLoad and LocalPrice. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values of the Load and Price data and for the LocalLoad and LocalPrice data for all the data values and save the time of the maximum Load value and the Price at that time and the LocalLoad and LocalPrice. Store the maximum temperature using the function putSensorValueByName with the name "MaxTempForecast". Get and display the value of PeakThresholdLoad using the function getSensorValueByName. If the maximum load value is greater than PeakThresholdLoad, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "GOLD". If the LocalLoad is greater than 3500, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "GOLD". If the maximum price value is greater than 30, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "SILVER". If the value is greater than 25, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "BRONZE". If the value is less than 20, then it is "NOGAME". If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". Set the LMP to the price when the Load value is maximum. Set the startime to the datetime when the Load or Price value was selected minus 1 hour and set the duration to 120 mins. If the projected_peak_datetime_ept and pjm_load_forecast in the operations report JSON data is the same as the maximun load then display "MAX LOAD CONFIRMED".

The columns are Datetime, Load, Price, Temp, Forecast, LocalLoad and LocalPrice. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values of the Load and Price data and for the LocalLoad and LocalPrice data for all the data values and save the time of the maximum Load value and the Price at that time and the LocalLoad and LocalPrice. Store the maximum temperature using the function putSensorValueByName with the name "MaxTempForecast". Get and display the value of PeakThresholdLoad using the function getSensorValueByName. If PeakThresholdLoad is not found, use the value 130,000 for PeakThresholdLoad. If the maximum load value is greater than PeakThresholdLoad, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "GOLD". If the LocalLoad is greater than 3500, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "GOLD". If the maximum price value is greater than 30, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "SILVER". If the value is greater than 25, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "BRONZE". If the value is less than 20, then it is "NOGAME". If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". Set the LMP to the price when the Load value is maximum. Set the startime to the datetime when the Load or Price value was selected minus 1 hour and set the duration to 120 mins. If the projected_peak_datetime_ept and pjm_load_forecast in the operations report JSON data is the same as the maximun load then display "MAX LOAD CONFIRMED".
