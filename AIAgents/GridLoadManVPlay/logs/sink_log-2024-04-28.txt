### Summary Results

#### Average Values
- **Load**: Not processed due to internal error.
- **Price**: Not processed due to internal error.
- **Local Load**: Not processed due to internal error.
- **Local Price**: Not processed due to internal error.

#### Maximum Values
- The maximum **Load** was at **19:00** on **04/28/2024** with a value that triggered a "MAX LOAD CONFIRMED" status, aligning with the operations summary forecast.
- The maximum **Price**: was **$44.93**, indicating a high demand period.
- The maximum **Temperature** was recorded at **82°F**.

#### Actions Taken
- The maximum temperature forecasted has been stored with the tag "MaxTempForecast".
- A **Grid Peak Detected** message was sent to the **C2Agent**, along with corresponding **notice messages** to the **CommandCenter** and **ControlPanel**.
- The detected conditions warranted classifying the event as **"SHEDPOWER"** with an **award level** of **"GOLD"** due to the high Load value surpassing the PeakLoadThreshold.

Unfortunately, there was an issue processing some parts of the data, preventing a complete summary of the average and minimum values, but critical alerts and actions were successfully executed based on peak conditions observed.
