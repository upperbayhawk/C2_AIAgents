[2023-12-11 19:56:30.110757] DEBUG: runpump: Based on the temperature records for the last 10 minutes:

- The mean temperature in the Boston area was 43.9°F.
- The temperature variation (standard deviation) was approximately 0.1°F, indicating minor fluctuations.
- The rate of temperature change between consecutive minutes was as follows: no change for the first minute, an increase of 0.2°F in the second minute, then no changes for several minutes, a decrease of 0.2°F, followed by no changes and then an increase of 0.2°F in the last minute.

Given the minor changes in temperature, the weather in terms of temperature seems to be quite stable at the moment. The slight increases and decreases in temperature might be due to normal variations such as passing clouds or minor shifts in wind direction. There is no significant trend upwards or downwards in the temperature, suggesting stable weather conditions for the near term.

Please note that to make a more comprehensive weather analysis, other factors such as humidity, wind speed, pressure, and precipitation would need to be considered, but such data is not provided in the JSON snippet.
